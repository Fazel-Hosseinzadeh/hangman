## About

Hangman Game is a classic word guessing game where players attempt to uncover a hidden word by suggesting letters or providing the full answer. In this version of the game, you'll be pitted against the computer as your opponent.

The hidden word is represented by a series of dashes, with each dash representing a letter in the word. When you suggest a letter that exists in the word, it will be revealed in all its correct positions. However, if your suggestion is incorrect, the computer will incrementally draw the hangman diagram.

The game continues until either the entire word is guessed correctly or the hangman's diagram is completed, resulting in a loss. You have a total of 7 attempts to decipher the word correctly and emerge victorious.

All the words used in this game are categorized into four categories: Countries, Animals, Foods, and Objects.

  - #### 3.Menu

    - Once the player is eligible to play the Hangman Game, they are presented with a main menu that offers three options: viewing the game rules, starting the game, or exiting the game. The main menu allows the player to choose their desired action.
      The player can enter the corresponding number to select their desired option.

           - If the player selects option 1, the game displays the rules of the Hangman Game.
           - If the player selects option 2, the game starts and the player can begin guessing the letters to uncover the secret word.
           - If the player selects option 3, the game exits gracefully with a goodbye message.

    The main menu provides an easy and intuitive way for the player to access the different functionalities of the game, allowing them to choose whether to view the rules, play the game, or exit.

- #### 4. Category Selection

- #### 5. Word Guessing

  - After selecting a category, the player enters the word guessing phase of the game. The user interface will display several elements to assist the player in their guessing process.
    1. Category: The chosen category will be displayed at the top of the screen, reminding the player of the theme of the secret word.
    2. Used Letters: A list of letters that the player has already guessed will be shown. This helps the player avoid repeating guesses.
    3. Secret Word: The secret word is represented by a series of dashes, with each dash representing a letter in the word. Initially, all letters are hidden, and dashes are displayed instead. As the player correctly guesses letters, the corresponding dashes are replaced with the revealed letters.
    4. Hangman Stage: A graphical representation of the hangman will be displayed. With each incorrect guess, a new part of the hangman is added, gradually completing the figure. The stage of the hangman visually indicates the player's progress and the number of incorrect guesses made so far.

  The player will be prompted to enter a letter as their guess. If the letter is valid (a single alphabetic character that has not been previously guessed), the game will evaluate whether the letter is present in the secret word. If the guessed letter is correct, it will be revealed in the corresponding positions in the secret word. Otherwise, the hangman stage will progress, indicating an incorrect guess.

- #### 5. Result

  - The game continues until one of the following conditions is met:

    - The player correctly guesses the entire secret word, resulting in a victory.
    - The hangman stage is completed, indicating that the player has run out of allowed incorrect guesses, resulting in a loss.

    At the end of the game, the player will be notified of the outcome (win or loss) and shown the complete secret word.

- ### Future Features
      - In order to cater to a wider audience, the Hangman game can be enhanced with multi-language support. This feature allows players to enjoy the game in languages other than English.

## Design

- To enhance the visual appeal and create a more engaging user interface, the Hangman game utilizes ANSI escape codes to change the background colors. This feature adds a touch of color and liveliness to the terminal-based game.

Here's how the design aspect is implemented:

1.  Background Color Selection: The game utilizes a dictionary of ANSI escape codes, mapping different color names to their corresponding escape sequences. These color names include black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan, white, and reset (to revert back to the default color).

2.  Colorful Text Output: The chosen background color is applied to the text by surrounding it with the appropriate escape sequences. This creates a visually distinct and colorful presentation for different sections of the game, such as menu options, messages, and graphical elements.

3.  Color Feedback: The background color is used to provide visual feedback to the player. For example, a correct letter guessed might be displayed in green, indicating success, while an incorrect letter might be displayed in red, indicating a wrong guess. This color feedback enhances the gaming experience and helps the player easily interpret the game's status.

By utilizing ANSI escape codes for background color changes, the Hangman game achieves a more vibrant and visually appealing user interface. The use of colors adds an extra dimension to the gameplay and creates an immersive experience for the players.
