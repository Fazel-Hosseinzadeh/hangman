## About

Hangman Game is a classic word guessing game where players attempt to uncover a hidden word by suggesting letters or providing the full answer. In this version of the game, you'll be pitted against the computer as your opponent.

The hidden word is represented by a series of dashes, with each dash representing a letter in the word. When you suggest a letter that exists in the word, it will be revealed in all its correct positions. However, if your suggestion is incorrect, the computer will incrementally draw the hangman diagram.

The game continues until either the entire word is guessed correctly or the hangman's diagram is completed, resulting in a loss. You have a total of 7 attempts to decipher the word correctly and emerge victorious.

All the words used in this game are categorized into four categories: Countries, Animals, Foods, and Objects.
